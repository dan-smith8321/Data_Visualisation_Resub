# Data_Visualisation_Resub
Resub of DAT 405

This piece of work itself is visualising data based from a Json file it's taking the names of Pokemon from the JSON file which acts as a database and is displaying it on the canvas. I have created 3 buttons which each show something different; when each one is clicked it displays a name took from the JSON file and displays it on my canvas.
