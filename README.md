# Data_Visualisation_Resub
Resub of DAT 405

This piece of work which I created is visualising data took from a JSON file by taking the names from the databases and displaying it on my canvas along with the images to match that specific pokemon name underneath it. I created six buttons on my canvas in order to each load a different name and image on the canvas when clicked. I originally started with only three buttons and three names and images already displayed but I decided for purposes of my work looking better that I'd have all six load through button presses. 

It's aim is to visualise data in a creative way rather than just having pokemon data loaded into tables or graphs like most visualisations I've found tend to display the data.
